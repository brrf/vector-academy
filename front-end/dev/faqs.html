								Not really. Early admission is designed to let you know if you got into Vector before you find out about your college early admission results. This gives you time to withdraw your college application without a penalty.<br><br>
								Only apply to Vector early admission companies if you would prefer to work at those companies over your top college choice.

							</p>
						</li>
						<li class="accordion-item">

							<p class="accordion-panel">
								Yes. As part of your application, you will select from the list of Vector Companies. You can select anywhere from one to all the companies. You will only be considered for an interview at the companies in which you’ve expressed interest.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li class="accordion-item">

								No. Only pick companies that do work that interests you. Doing something you are not interested in will be bad for both you and the company.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li class="accordion-item">
